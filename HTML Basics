We're going to create our very first website! Although it may not look perfect, it will be functional.
To accomplish this, we will use a language called HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language. 
HTML may not function like a typical programming language, but it is important because it allows us to create the structure and content of our web pages. 
Think of it like English, where we use words and sentences to communicate, but we can't execute it like a computer program. When we use HTML, we add special symbols or tags to our text to show how it should be displayed.
We can use HTML to add various types of content to our web pages, including text, images, and videos.
Strcutre of HTML Page:
Every HTML page contains 2 parts:
1. Head 
2. Body
Head contains meta data like Title of the page,keywords etc.
CSS and JAVA script files information we have to specify in the Head part only
Body contains actual content:
1) <!doctype html>// to indicate that it is HTML page
2) <html > 
3) <head> 
4) Meta Data like keywords,author,title...
5)css files information 
6) js files information
7) </head>
8) <body> 
9)Actual Data
10) </body> 
11) </html>
