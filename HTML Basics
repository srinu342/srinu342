We're going to make our first website. It might not look great, but it'll work! To do this, we'll use a language called HTML.
HTML doesn't actually do anything like a programming language does, but it's important because it helps us create the structure and content of our web pages.
Think of it like English - we use it to write words and sentences, but we can't "run" it like a computer program.
When we use HTML, we add special symbols or tags to our text to show how it should be displayed. 
We call this "markup". Our web page will have content like text, images, and videos, which we'll add using HTML. 
Finally, we call content that doesn't change or update "static".
